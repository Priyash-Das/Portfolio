                            Hi there! I'm
                            <strong>Priyash Das</strong>
                            , a full-stack developer, AI explorer, mentor, and tech dreamer, based in Kolkata, India. Born on
                            <strong>March 16, 2003</strong>
                            ( Unmarried &#129322;), I grew up fascinated by how machines think - and even more by how humans
                            <em>teach</em>
                            them to.

                        <h3>🚀 My Journey</h3>
                        <p>
                            I'm currently pursuing my
                            <strong>B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering</strong>
                            at
                            <strong>Budge Budge Institute of Technology</strong>
                            (BBIT). My academic life has been shaped by curiosity, and I've always leaned toward learning by building. Whether it's crafting web apps, writing automation scripts, or exploring the depths of Generative AI, I've always believed that
                            <strong>tech should feel like magic - but built with logic</strong>
                            .
                        </p>
                        <p>What started as simple HTML pages quickly evolved into full-blown MERN stack apps. From learning core concepts on YouTube and bootcamps to publishing research at an international conference, I've been leveling up one commit at a time.</p>
