I'm <strong>Priyash Das</strong>, a full-stack developer, AI explorer, mentor, and tech dreamer, based in Kolkata, India. Born on <strong>March 16, 2003</strong>( Unmarried &#129322;), I grew up fascinated by how machines think - and even more by how humans <em>teach</em>them to. </p></section><section class="content-section"><h3>🚀 My Journey</h3><p>I'm currently pursuing my <strong>B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering</strong>at <strong>Budge Budge Institute of Technology</strong>(BBIT). My academic life has been shaped by curiosity, and I've always leaned toward learning by building. Whether it's crafting web apps, writing automation scripts, or exploring the depths of Generative AI, I've always believed that <strong>tech should feel like magic - but built with logic</strong>. </p><p>What started as simple HTML pages quickly evolved into full-blown MERN stack apps. From learning core concepts on YouTube and bootcamps to publishing research at an international conference, I've been leveling up one commit at a time.</p></section><section class="content-section"><h3>🧰 My Toolbox</h3><p>I specialize in crafting <strong>clean, responsive, and engaging interfaces</strong>and pairing them with powerful backends. But I don't stop at code. I dive deep into: </p><ul><li>🔁 <strong>Prompt Engineering</strong>& <strong>Generative AI</strong>using Google Cloud APIs, NLP, and ASR systems. </li><li>🔍 Debugging weird edge cases for hours because one <code>console.log</code>didn't log. True story. </li><li>🎨 UI/UX design in <strong>Figma</strong>and <strong>Canva</strong>when I want things to “look just right”. </li></ul></section><section class="content-section"><h3>💼 Real-World XP</h3><p>My learning goes beyond tutorials - I've walked the talk:</p><ul><li><strong>Intern @ NHRC:</strong>Explored legal-tech, published research, and secured a <strong>Top 3 project finish</strong>. </li><li><strong>Mentor @ GDSC BBIT:</strong>Guided peers through <strong>Gen AI bootcamps</strong>on tools like <strong>Vertex AI</strong>, achieving a 100% completion rate. </li><li><strong>Trainee @ Wipro & Infosys:</strong>Gained industry-level exposure in <strong>Java full-stack</strong>, <strong>Data Analytics</strong>, and real-world software workflows. </li></ul></section><section class="content-section"><h3>🛠️ Projects I'm Proud Of</h3><p>Each of my projects reflects a blend of <strong>creativity, purpose,</strong>and <strong>technical challenge</strong>, including <strong>MiniBnB (Airbnb clone)</strong>and <strong>SONIX (a voice-controlled assistant)</strong>, which was published at an international conference. </p></section><section class="content-section"><h3>💬 What Drives Me?</h3><p>I believe in <strong>tech with purpose</strong>- building systems that solve real problems, uplift communities, and create meaningful experiences. I'm fueled by constant learning, creative side projects, and a balance of hustle and calm. </p></section><section class="content-section"><h3>🎧 Outside the Code</h3><p>When I'm not typing like a mad scientist at 2am, I enjoy listening to music, binging YouTube videos on AI breakthroughs, and designing random logos or UI layouts just for fun.</p></section><section class="content-section"><h3>🔗 Let's Connect</h3><p>I'm always open to collaborating, joining exciting teams, or just talking about AI, open-source, or life over virtual chai ☕. Let's build something cool.</p><div class="social-links"><a href="https://github.com/Priyash-Das" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="social-link" >🖥️ GitHub</a><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/priyash-das" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="social-link" >🔗 LinkedIn</a></div></section></main></div></div><script src="about-script.js"></script></body></html>
